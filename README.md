# Huffman-Coding-Trees-Haskell
A simple take on Huffman Coding Trees using Haskell. 

Algorithm/concept developed by David A. Huffman. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Huffman

A detailed expanation and history of Huffman coding trees can be found here:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding
  
Informal description:
  - Given a set of symbols and their weights, find a prefix-free binary code (a set of codewords)
    with minimum expect codeword length (equivalently, a tree with minimum weighted path length
    from the root).

  - Another way to think of a Huffman Coding Tree is lossless data compression. Basically the concept
    behind what happens when you compress a file into a .zip
